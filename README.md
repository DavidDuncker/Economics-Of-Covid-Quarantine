# Economics-Of-Covid-Quarantine

The purpose of this project is to gather data to determine if the costs associated with mandatory quarantines and isolation outweighs the costs of letting SARS-CoV-2 spread completely uninhibited.

The mechanism for the comparison is two-fold: 

1) Make a model that creates a linear regression relating revenues from various economic sectors and industries to various causes of death, then predict how many lives will be lost from an economic downturn. Then make a model of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Compare the number of deaths.

2) Use previous model on SARS-CoV-2 spread to predict the number of deaths. Then make a model that estimates the marginal value of an extra year of life. Use that to predict the total cost of the epidemic, and compare to the costs that worldwide quarantines have on the market.
